Components used:
1.	Arduino Uno R3
2.	Optical dust sensor (GP2Y1010AU0F)
3.	2 sonar sensors (HC-SR04)
4.	Signal buzzer
5.	Mini water pump
6.	I2C LCD display (16x2)
7.	Lead acid battery
8.	1 channel 5V relay

While there are two sonars listed only has been used. Because either the other one was never properly connected to begin with or it somehow got disconnected while the project was being moved around. Debugging it would mean, opening up the entire project which has been glued using hot glue.
